    <p>Hello! My name is Benjamin Dow. People often call me Ben or Benji (take your pick). </p>
    <p>
        I am a Software Engineer specializing in Backend Development, particularly cloud-first SaaS solutions.
        I am currently employed at Deka Research & Development in Manchester, New Hampshire, USA.
    </p>

    <p>
        When I am not Programming I am an avid outdoorsman. I enjoy hiking, camping, biking, climbing, skiing and most other "ing"
        words that you can do in New Hampshire. I'm always looking for new adventures and places to visit. Sometimes on these
        adventures I take pictures.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also dabble in Lighting Design. I've spent a number of years progrming and designing lights for theatre and other events.
        I am most familiar with the ETC EOS ecosystem of consoles.
